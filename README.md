# Don't repeat boring tasks if you're a programmer.
Windows, Macos, Linux I couldn't find a good email client which works for all. There is Thunderbird it was taking a lot of memory. Gnome Evolution isn't much customizable from the UI side and its difficult to recognize new emails with the default UI. Plus every new email client I tried, I needed to generate the email rules from them every time, there isn't any solution to write one email rule for all.

I decided to use the web clients and use this setup to organize my emails.  

## Advantages:
- Platform independant
- Lite in memory

## Gmail : 
Get app specific email password for gmail at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## Outlook :
usual email and password combination should work


To Run:
```
pip install imapclient

# Export EMAIL and EMAIL_PWD into enviornment variables

python main.py
```
